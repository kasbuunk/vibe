## Actor Model Principles

### 1. Actor Design

1. **Pure Function Actors**
   - Each actor is a pure function
   - State changes through immutable events
   - No shared mutable state
   - Inspired by Haskell's purity

2. **Message Passing**
   - Actors communicate via messages
   - Asynchronous message passing
   - No direct state access
   - Type-safe message protocols

3. **Event-Driven Behavior**
   - Actors react to events
   - Event sourcing for state
   - Event publishing/subscribing
   - Event replay capability

### 2. State Management

1. **Event Sourced State**
   - Immutable event history
   - State derived from events
   - Event snapshots for efficiency
   - Consistent state recovery

2. **Actor State**
   - Local immutable state
   - Event-driven updates
   - Event replay for recovery
   - Consistent snapshots

3. **Distributed State**
   - Event store for persistence
   - Event streaming for updates
   - Event replay for consistency
   - Event validation

### 3. Communication Patterns

1. **Actor Communication**

### 4. Agent Implementation

1. **Agent as Actor**
   - Each agent is an actor
   - Pure function behavior
   - Event-driven updates
   - Independent operation

### 5. Testing Strategy

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Actor collaboration
   - Event sourcing
   - State recovery
   - System behavior

## Domain Modeling

### 1. Actor-Based Modeling

1. **Domain Actors**
   - Actors represent domain concepts
   - Pure function behaviors
   - Event-driven state
   - Independent operation

2. **Event Modeling**
   - Business-meaningful events
   - Event boundaries
   - Event versioning
   - Event validation

3. **State Modeling**
   - Event-sourced state
   - Event snapshots
   - State recovery
   - Consistency checks

### 2. Functional Integration

1. **Pure Functions**
   - Actor behaviors
   - Event processing
   - State transitions
   - Event validation

2. **Immutability**
   - Event immutability
   - Actor state
   - Event history
   - Event snapshots

3. **Type Safety**
   - Message types
   - Event types
   - State types

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start Small**: Begin with minimal viable components
2. **Evolve Gradually**: Add complexity incrementally
3. **Maintain Clean Code**: Prioritize readability and maintainability
4. **Document Decisions**: Keep detailed development logs
5. **Test Everything**: Write tests before implementation
6. **Monitor Everything**: Use OpenTelemetry for observability

## Actor Implementation Example

```rust
// Example of an actor-based implementation
#[derive(Debug)]
struct DeveloperActor {
    state: DeveloperState,
    event_store: EventStore,
}

impl DeveloperActor {
    // Pure function behavior
    async fn handle_message(&self, message: Message) -> Result<Events> {
        // Process message and generate events
        Ok(self.generate_events(message))
    }

    // Event sourcing
    async fn update_state(&mut self, events: Events) -> Result<()> {
        // Update state from events
        self.state = self.state.apply_events(events);
        Ok(())
    }

    // Event publishing
    async fn publish_events(&self, events: Events) -> Result<()> {
        // Publish events to NATS JetStream
        self.event_store.publish(events).await
    }

    // Event subscription
    async fn subscribe_events(&self) -> Result<Stream> {
        // Subscribe to relevant events
        self.event_store.subscribe().await
    }
}
```

This architecture combines:
- Actor model for independent, concurrent processing
- Event sourcing for state management
- Pure functions for behavior
- Functional programming principles
- Domain-driven design
- Type-safe communication
