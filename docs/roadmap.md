## Key Principles

1. **Incremental Development**
   - Start with minimal viable components
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Maintain working system at all times

2. **Test-Driven Approach**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Maintain comprehensive test coverage
   - Use tests to drive architecture

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regular process review
   - Agent self-improvement
   - Systematic enhancement
   - Learning from feedback

4. **Documentation Focus**
   - Maintain development logs
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Document architectural decisions
   - Track learning journey

## Milestone Definitions
