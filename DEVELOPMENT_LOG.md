# Vibe Development Log

## Project Principles

### Code Flow and Learning Principles
- **Test First**: Write failing tests to understand the problem before solving it
- **Flow Focus**: Work in harmony with development tools and processes
- **Immediate Feedback**: Use tests and documentation to maintain flow
- **Conventional Commits**: Use semantic prefixes to maintain project history
- **Documentation**: Capture the learning journey through logs and README
- **Learning**: Document decisions, lessons, and adapt principles as needed

### Development Approach
- The HTTP server is a vehicle for learning
- Focus on the development process itself
- Maintain transparency in decision-making
- Document the journey of learning and adaptation

## 2025-05-15

### 20:25 - Initial Project Setup
- Created new Rust project using TDD approach
- Implemented basic HTTP server with Axum
- Added comprehensive test suite
- Key decisions:
  - Used Axum over Warp for HTTP server
  - Implemented proper test isolation without starting real server
  - Used `tower::ServiceExt` for testing

### 20:35 - Project Structure and Testing
- Restructured test to test production code directly
- Implemented proper HTTP testing using `tower::ServiceExt`
- Fixed test isolation issues
- Key learning:
  - Importance of testing actual production code
  - Proper use of Rust's async/await patterns in tests

### 20:44 - Version Control Setup
- Initialized git repository
- Added remote origin to GitHub
- Created initial commit with conventional commit message
- Renamed branch to main
- Key decisions:
  - Used conventional commits (`feat:`, `test:`, `docs:`)
  - Maintained clean git history

### 20:46 - Documentation
- Added comprehensive README.md
- Included setup instructions, development workflow, and project structure
- Key content:
  - Clear setup instructions
  - Development workflow explanation
  - Project structure overview

### 20:47 - CI/CD Setup
- Added GitHub Actions workflow
- Implemented automated testing
- Added clippy linting
- Key features:
  - Runs on push and pull requests
  - Includes build, test, and lint steps
  - Uses Ubuntu runner with latest Rust toolchain

### 20:58 - Pipeline Monitoring
- Added `check_pipeline.sh` script for monitoring GitHub Actions
- Implemented detailed status reporting
- Added GitHub CLI authentication to prerequisites
- Script enhancements:
  - Detailed workflow information
  - Failed job reporting
  - Timestamp tracking
  - Active run detection

### 21:07 - Development Process Evolution
- Realized the project's true purpose is about learning to "vibe" with code
- Updated README to reflect the learning journey focus
- Documenting development process and principles as a key value
- Shifted perspective from "HTTP server" to "code flow exploration"
- Defined AI Agency framework for collaborative AI development
- Created structured approach for implementing AI-driven development
- Established foundation for iterative AI agent development
- Documented core components and development workflow

## Development Principles

### Design Philosophy
- Adopted functional programming principles in Rust
- Embraced CNCF technologies (Kubernetes, NATS, OpenTelemetry)
- Chose PostgreSQL and Redis for data storage
- Implemented OpenTelemetry with LGTM stack
- Created comprehensive design philosophy document
- Implemented async_trait for async Rust traits
- Used proper module structure for test organization
- Created clean test cleanup patterns
- Implemented basic message passing with mpsc
- Added comprehensive error handling for file operations

### Development Tools
- Added `check_pipeline.sh` script to monitor GitHub Actions status
- Script uses GitHub CLI to check workflow runs
- Provides detailed status including workflow name, status, conclusion, and timestamps
- Automatically shows failed jobs if a run fails
- Helps maintain visibility into CI/CD pipeline status

## Development Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Tests should be small and focused
   - Tests should be easy to understand and maintain
   - Tests should verify business requirements
   - **CRITICAL**: Only commit code changes if ALL tests pass
     - This ensures code quality and maintainability
     - Prevents breaking changes from being committed
     - Maintains a clean git history

2. **Code Quality**
   - Use conventional commit messages
   - Maintain clean git history
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow Rust best practices

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep README up to date
   - Document key decisions
   - Include setup instructions
   - Maintain development log

## Future Considerations

1. **Testing Improvements**
   - Add more comprehensive test coverage
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add benchmark tests

2. **Documentation**
   - Add API documentation
   - Include contribution guidelines
   - Add deployment instructions

3. **CI/CD**
   - Add automated deployments
   - Implement code coverage reporting
   - Add more linting rules

## Lessons Learned

1. **Testing Strategy**
   - Testing production code directly is more reliable
   - Proper test isolation prevents flaky tests
   - Using proper HTTP testing tools is crucial

2. **Project Structure**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Proper organization of test code
   - Maintainable dependency management

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Conventional commits improve traceability
   - Automated testing catches issues early
   - Proper documentation saves time
